In order to run the C code you need a development environment set up on your computer.
Install a C compiler, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux or MinGW on Windows.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your source code is located.
Run the following command to compile the codes: (The different methods of implementation have been carefully written in three seperate C files within this directory)

gcc -o [output file name] [.c file] 

This command will create an executable file with the specified output file name.

Run the executable file by typing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

./[output file name]

This will run the program and display the output.

To view the code, if you have vim istalled, simply run the code:
vi [.c file].
