In order to run the C code you need a development environment set up on your computer.
Install a C compiler, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux or MinGW on Windows.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your source code is located.
Run the following command to compile the code:

gcc -o [output file name] Coding - Test _ Question.c

This command will create an executable file with the specified output file name.

Run the executable file by typing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

./[output file name]

This will run the program and display the output.

It's important to note that the commands and steps may vary depending on your operating system and the specific tools you are using.
